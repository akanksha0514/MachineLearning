# MachineLearning
This is the sourcecode of Kaggle's machine learning exercise: Building Machine learning models.

I have used scikit-learn library to create a model.
The steps to building and using a model are:

    Define: The type of model will be a decision tree
    Fit: Captured features from the provided data that are useful for building a model
    Predict: Gives the sales price prediction
    Evaluate: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are.

Download fashion training and test datasets using below link: 
https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist#fashion-mnist_train.csv

1. Load data, build and evaluate machine learning models using scikit-learn3.Load and explore the MNIST fashion training dataset.

2. Split the training dataset into train and validation datasets using 70:30 split

3. Experimented with different machine learning algorithms to see if a better model can be build (ensembles, bagging, boosting, random forests, xgboostclassifier)
