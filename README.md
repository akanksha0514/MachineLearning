This is the sourcecode of Kaggle's machine learning exercise: Building Machine learning models
I have used scikit-learn library to create a model.
The steps to building and using a model are:

    Define: The type of model will be a decision tree
    Fit: Captured features from the provided data that are useful for building a model
    Predict: Gives the sales price prediction
    Evaluate: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are.
